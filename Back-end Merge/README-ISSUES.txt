Main problems:

-Problem: About and contact sections have been removed due to automatic update 
with scroll feature.

Fix: Move to a seperate page HREF

-Problem: styling with SUBMIT AND ADD button are offset in phone view

Fix: Please restyle them

Problem: Add Freshfridge typing effect / title to index

Fix: code is already made, just copy and paste


Other issues (If time): 
-Please style recipes as they come in and if possible
on phone mode only one per row but in desktop 3 per row

-Please add a button that follows you with scroll that allows you to go back to the top of the page (There is already code for one in index)

<a href="#about" class="btn btn-circle js-scroll-trigger">
    <i class="fa fa-angle-double-down animated"></i>
